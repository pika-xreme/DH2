The placeholder Mega graphics were all made by the inimitable DrPumpkinz. 

A handful of Mega Stone sprites (as well as the sprite for Acidic Seed) were made by woworiginal.

The Smogon Sprite Project backsprites for Mega Medicham and Mega Garchomp have also been edited here, because they were driving inkbug mad.
